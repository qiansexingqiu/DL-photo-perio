## Brief Instruction
This study proposes a deep learning model for nonclinical screening of periodontitis using oral images. A Global Activation Pooling-based multi-instance learning model (DLM) built on ResNet-50 was trained and validated in two independent cohorts from Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital. The model used unannotated frontal oral images to detect stage II–IV periodontitis, with clinical periodontal examination or panoramic radiograph-based diagnosis as reference. The model achieved an AUROC of 0.93 in both internal and external datasets and outperformed clinicians in sensitivity and specificity. Heatmaps showed strong alignment with periodontist-identified regions. Combining image data with nonclinical parameters yielded only marginal gains, highlighting the potential of image-based AI screening for periodontitis.
